# Rock-Paper-Scissors
<br />03.05.2022:
Started the "Rock paper scissors" mini-game couple of months ago but didn't get very far. I just couldn't get it to play more than once and if it played more than once i just played with the same values so i decided to leave it be for the time being. I got to the Assignment where you need to add UI i decided to revisit and try to finish it so i can build from there.
<br />Couldn't figure out where should i start and overall the code was really messy so i decided to scrape it and build from 0. The new code basically does what it is supposed to do. Most likely needs to be refined, but i'll leave it be for now. At some point i had to look for some help, because i wasn't sure i'm making any progress and it was getting kind of late but i wanted to finish before bed. 
So here it is, my take on the classic Rock Paper Scissor. Soon with UI, hopefully!

Finished the UI for the game. It's very basic and blocky. But it is still my first ever code with any kind of UI that i wrote, so i'm going to leave it like that for now, may come back later to shake things up.
